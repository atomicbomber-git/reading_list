        <h1> What I Am Reading Right Now and What I Have Read So Far (As of January, 2017) </h1>
        <p> 
            Hi, I am <strong> Anton </strong>, but I call myself <strong> James </strong> on the Internet. Here's what I am currently reading
            and what I have read since the beginning of 2017. I write this to suggest these books to you,
             and to remind myself of my intention to read as often as possible.
